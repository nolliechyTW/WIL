=======================================================================================<br>
Given an `m x n` grid of characters board and a string word, return `true` if word exists in the grid.<br>

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.<br>

**Follow up**: Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger board?


Example 1:<br>
![image1](image.png)<br>
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],<br>
                ["S","F","C","S"],<br>
                ["A","D","E","E"]],<br> 
                word = "ABCCED"<br>
Output: true<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],<br>
                ["S","F","C","S"],<br>
                ["A","D","E","E"]],<br>
                word = "SEE"<br>
Output: true<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],<br>
                ["S","F","C","S"],<br>
                ["A","D","E","E"]],<br>
                word = "ABCB"<br>
Output: false<br>


Constraints:<br>
- m == board.length
- n = board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 6
- 1 <= word.length <= 15
- `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

### UMPIRE Method:
#### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Can the input `board` or `word` be empty? 
    - the smallest `board` would be 1 row and 1 column ; the shortest `word` would be 1 character long
2. Any requirement on time/space complexity?
3. What if we come across the same letter during the search path?
    - During the search path, set the visited letter as visited to avoid reuse
4. Is it possible that the word is longer than then number of possible squares in 2D-Array?
    - Yes


### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category


1. Backtracking <br>
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.


### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

General Idea: Utilize Depth-First Search (DFS) and Backtracking at each cell of the 2D grid to explore the possibility of forming the target word. Each DFS iteration either progresses towards a potential match or backtracks to explore alternative paths

1) Initial Validation:
Verify if the word's length exceeds the total number of cells in the grid.

2) Helper Function - Word Search:
    - Initiate the function with boundary checks: return `false` if the position is out of bounds or if the cell's character doesn't match the current word character
    - Confirm word completion: if the end of the word is reached, return `true`
    - Mark the current cell as visited by temporarily modifying its value to `*`
    - Recursively search adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) for the next character in the word
    - Implement Backtracking: Revert the cell to its original state after recursive exploration
    - Return the search outcome (`true` if the word is found, `false` otherwise)

3) Main Function (board, word):
    - Iterate over the grid, using the helper function to check for the word starting at each cell
    - If a match is found at any cell, return `true`
    - If all cells have been checked without finding the word, conclude that the word cannot be formed and return `false`
    

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

see solution.py

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

- Assume N represents the number of rows in 2D-array 
- Assume M represents the number of columns in 2D-array
- Assume L represents the number of characters in the word

- Time Complexity: O(N * M * 3 ^ L) we need to start at each character in the 2D-Array. Then we need to perform a dfs on 3 possible paths for the word. And we need to do this at each character
- Space Complexity: O(L) we may need to store the length of our word as depth in our recursion stack
