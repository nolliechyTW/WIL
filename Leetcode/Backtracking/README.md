## Backtracking Template

Here's a basic structure of the backtracking template:

1) Function Signature: Define the function with relevant parameters, including the data structure you're working on, the index or position you're currently at, and any other necessary variables.

2) Base Case: Determine the condition at which you've reached a potential solution or an end point. At this stage, you usually either record the solution or return a value.

3) **Choices** and **Constraints**: At each step, you'll have a set of choices. You need to iterate over these choices, applying constraints to prune the search space.

4) Make a Choice: Apply a choice to your data structure or state.

5) Recursive Call: Call your function recursively with the new state or the next position.

6) Backtrack: After exploring one choice, you need to revert the state back to its original form before trying the next choice. This step is crucial as it ensures that the changes made by one choice do not affect the exploration of other choices.

7) Return Results: Depending on the problem, you may need to return a boolean value indicating success/failure, or you might be collecting all valid solutions in a list.

Here is a simple example in code:<br>

```
    def backtrack(result, path, choices, index):
        # Base Case: Condition to check if current path is a solution
        if is_solution(path):
            result.append(path.copy())
            return

        for choice in choices:
            # Apply Constraints: Check if the current choice is valid
            if is_valid_choice(path, choice):
                # Make a Choice
                path.append(choice)

                # Recursive Call
                backtrack(result, path, choices, index + 1)

                # Backtrack: Remove the last choice
                path.pop()

    # Usage
    result = []
    backtrack(result, [], choices, 0)
```
