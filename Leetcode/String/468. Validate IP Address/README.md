=======================================================================================<br>

Given a string `queryIP`, return `"IPv4"` if IP is a valid IPv4 address, `"IPv6"` if IP is a valid IPv6 address or `"Neither"` if IP is not a correct IP of any type.

A valid **IPv4** address is an IP in the form "`x1.x2.x3.x4`" where `0 <= xi <= 255` and `xi` cannot contain leading zeros. For example, `"192.168.1.1"` and `"192.168.1.0"` are valid IPv4 addresses while `"192.168.01.1"`, `"192.168.1.00"`, and `"192.168@1.1"` are invalid IPv4 addresses.

A valid **IPv6** address is an IP in the form `"x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8"` where:
- 1 <= xi.length <= 4
- xi is a hexadecimal string which may contain digits, lowercase English letter ('a' to 'f') and upper-case English letters ('A' to 'F').
- Leading zeros are allowed in xi.<br>

For example, `"2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334"` and `"2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"` are valid IPv6 addresses, while `"2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:037j:7334"` and `"02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334"` are invalid IPv6 addresses.


Example 1:<br>
Input: queryIP = "172.16.254.1"<br>
Output: "IPv4"<br>
Explanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".<br>


Example 2:<br>
Input: queryIP = "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"<br>
Output: "IPv6"<br>
Explanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: queryIP = "256.256.256.256"<br>
Output: "Neither"<br>
Explanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.<br>

Constraints:<br>
- queryIP consists only of `English letters`, `digits` and the characters `'.'` and `':'`.<br>

### UMPIRE Method:
#### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1.  Any requirement on time/space complexity?
- O(N) in Time and O(1) in space

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category


- String manipulation

### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

General Idea: validate IP addresses by distinguishing between IPv4 and IPv6 formats based on their unique structural characteristics, using string manipulation and condition checks to ensure compliance with the respective standards.


### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

see solution.py

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

Assume N is the length of the input IP string `queryIP`.

- Time Complexity: O(N), because to count number of dots requires to
parse the entire input string
- Space Complexity: O(1)
